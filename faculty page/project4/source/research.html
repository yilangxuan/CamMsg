		<h1>Research Interests</h1>
		<p class='informationalparagraph'>Prof. Jim Davis, Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, is developing advanced video surveillance systems that use computers equipped with video cameras to not only detect the presence of people and track them, but also to identify their activities. The research has broad implications for Homeland Security as well as search and rescue, border patrol, law enforcement and many other types of military applications. The systems combine video cameras with machine learning methods, enabling the computer to perform the kind of visual recognition that seems effortless for humans. Davis' work in investigating computer vision methods was recognized by the National Science Foundation with the prestigious NSF Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program award. Support for this research (past and present) has been provided by the National Science Foundation, U.S. Air Force, Los Alamos National Lab, U.S. Army Night Vision Laboratory, Intel, and Ohio Board of Regents.</p>
